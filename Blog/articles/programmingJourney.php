            <p style="text-align: justify;font-size: 20px;line-height: 35px;font-family: 'Metal Mania', cursive;">I started this Programming  journey because i decided to study Computer science at the University.Programming has not been a very smooth journey for me,the first programming language i ever learnt was C programming which i started learning,during my first year university break
            .C programming language was more of Procedural and i find it not really interesting for me.I only decided to start to learn HTML and CSS during my first year break also.HTML and CSS was kind of fun to me even though there are so many syntax to know
            I also learnt java in my 2nd year first semester due to the school curriculum,java was okay but the syntax was too lengthy.During my second year at the University i learnt C++ Programming language,C++ was fun to learn because it is an Object oriented programming language
            .I had to watch some couple of tutorial videos,read some pdf to understand the concept behind it and asked some friends anytime i encounter any problem on some concept.
            During Year two i went for my first tech conference(CESA19) ,at the conference there were different speakers that talked about different tech fields such as Data Science & Machine Learning,Automation,Mobile Development and Data Visualization.I got attracted to data Science
            and i decided to learn Python for data science during my year two first semester break.I started learning python which was kind of easy for me to learn due to my previous knowledge of programming.After i was done with the  object oriented part i decided to learn some libraries such as
            pandas and matplotlib.I did data science for some time and i decided to switch back to web development because i was just not feeling the vibe to continue the data science probably due to lack of resources and lack of interest!
            I had to some relearn process to get hold to HTML and CSS.I also decided to learn bootstrap to reduce stress of writing CSS.After i was done with bootstrap i moved to javascript,learnt the basics.Javascript was kind of different from all the programming languages i have learnt before,
            most days i get frustrated on it trying to figure out some things work.I guess i rushed learning javascript because i saw my friends moving to JS framework and i moved to ReactJS .React was probably the weirdest syntax i have seen before,for like two weeks i was still stuck on understanding
            a particular crud application of a Brad Traversy crash course for a while.I took a break for a while because Javascript really messed with my head on what next i should to move into and i started learning PHP.PHP is a very easy language to actually understand
